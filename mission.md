# Mission Statement
Sometimes, I can glimpse the true beauty in the world. That brief moment, when I see a flower, or a bird, or an ocean wave, and I understand how everything is connected. How all of the atoms inside us once belonged to stars, and when we die, we will become a part of the earth again. I understand that this connectedness is not sad; it is the most beautiful part of being alive. There is no “meaning” to life, other than living. The meaning of life is to live.

I want to help other people see that beauty.

I want to nurture close relationships with people, places, animals, and plants that I love. Not more, but better. Yet I also shouldn’t close myself off to new people and experiences. By meeting more people and experiencing more things, I will love and appreciate my close relationships even more.

Happiness is not the absence of pain, stress, or anxiety. Happiness is the presence of joy, a feeling of bliss that allows us to transcend the pain of existence. Removing pain is still valuable, especially when the pain truly threatens our ability to self actualize. While a painless life isn’t the goal, it can be a byproduct of overflowing with joy.

I want to wake up each morning excited about the work I’m going to do that day. “Work” is not trading my time for money, it’s making a meaningful contribution to improving the human condition.

I want to make the future better for people – not just myself and my loved ones, but for everyone. I want my grandchildren to live in a world of hope, where we can dream of a better future and create it. Dreaming isn’t the end of the road, it’s the beginning. And once we have dreamt, it is time to create.

Creativity is valuable for its own sake. Making new things is the best way possible to appreciate what we have – to not just consume, but to improve, augment, and give back. Creating and producing allows us the opportunity to give more than we take. If more people strive for that, we will all be more fulfilled, and more full.

When I die, I don’t want to look back at a life wasted. The best way to avoid regrets is to appreciate what I have, and to give more than I take.
