## Games
I've developed a few games over the years:
* [Hullaballoon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hullaballoon/id1600965694) (2022) is my first iOS game.
* [Freecoil](https://mintysoul.itch.io/freecoil) (2018) is a free synthwave roguelite I released on Itch.
* [Itsy Blitzy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/858320/Itsy_Blitzy/) (2018) was the first game I released on Steam.
* [Rebel Turret](https://thejakey.itch.io/rebel-turret) (2016) was my first full game, a first-person metroidvania (ambitious, I know).
