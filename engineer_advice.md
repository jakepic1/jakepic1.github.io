# Advice for new software engineers
I remember being a new software engineer. It was exciting and scary – it felt like there were an impossible number of things to learn. So, after over a decade of professional software development, I decided to compile some advice that I would tell my younger self. I doubt little Jakey would have listened, but maybe this list will be helpful to someone else.

**Have fun.** This is your only life, so you'd better enjoy it. I'm not necessarily saying you should follow your passion, because "passion" is hard to define, and will lead you to navel gazing. Instead, just try to have fun with your work and life. It won’t _always_ be fun (nothing is). But try to find fulfilling jobs/relationships/hobbies that are fun at least some of the time. And don’t always take yourself too seriously.

**Start investing early.** As a software engineer, you have great earning potential. And if you’re early in your career, there’s a good chance that you have a long time for your wealth to compound. Don’t spend everything you earn, but don’t just sock it all into a bank account either.

**Learn the fundamentals.** If you didn't go to school for CS, there's a good chance that something like [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) will be invaluable. Learning computer science will help you understand what's *really* going on. If you just graduated from a CS program, then you already have a solid understanding of CS, but you probably lack software engineering skills. Learn how to test, how to write clean code, how to write in general, how to review others’ code, how to respond to criticism, and how to ask questions. Note that most of the things I just mentioned are communication skills.

**Experiment.** It can be easy to fall into a rut of a certain specialty – backend, frontend, mobile. Some people get even more specific – React, Kubernetes, Swift UI. If you get the opportunity, try doing projects at work that stretch you outside of your comfort zone and into an unfamiliar domain. Chances are, you’ll surprise yourself and pick it up quickly once you’re over the initial hump. If you don’t have the opportunity to do this at your job...

**Build things outside of your job.** It makes me sad to see the “TC or GTFO” mentality, mostly in people who will only write code outside of work if it means grinding Leetcode so they can job hop. It’s okay to prep for interviews, but at least once in your life, try to make something real. You don’t have to work on side projects all the time – in fact, you should definitely have a life outside of code. But just _try_ to see what you’re capable of when you’re in creative control and can make all your own decisions, outside of a corporate structure.

**Remember that people > code.** Your relationships with your coworkers and friends should long outlast the code you write. Even if you’re not outwardly mean, don’t have a mean internal monologue either – people can tell if you’re an asshole. Learn  compassion.

**Take care of your health, both mentally and physically.** Get a little exercise, try meditation, eat a vegetable, get enough sleep, seek therapy if necessary.

**Related: ergonomics matter.** Don’t wait until it’s too late to learn this.

**Don’t go into management just because you think you’re “supposed” to.** Do it if the challenge of building a team sounds more interesting than building software. If you become a manager, recognize that you won’t automatically be good at it. Even if you think you’re a natural, you don’t yet have the experience to judge your own performance very well. Treat it as a brand new skill set that you need to cultivate.

**Be true to yourself.** People have different reasons for getting into this profession. Some people just love to code, and couldn’t imagine doing anything else. For others, it’s a stable career that allows them to provide for their family. Don’t conflate others’ reasons for your own – if you do, you’ll always be dissatisfied. Find your “why” and pursue it unapologetically.
