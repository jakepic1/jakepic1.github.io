# Advice for new software engineers
If I could travel back in time 10 years, this is some of the advice I'd give myself.

## Have fun
This is your only life. "Passion" isn't important, and will lead you to navel gazing. Instead, try to have fun with your work and life. It won't *always* be fun (nothing is), but try to find fulfilling jobs/relationships/hobbies that are fun at least some of the time (the more the better). And don't always take yourself too seriously.

## Start investing early
As a software engineer, you have great earning potential. If you're early in your career, there's a good chance you have a long time for your wealth to compound. Don't spend everything you earn, but don't just sock all of the excess into a savings account either. Learn about low cost index funds.

## Learn the fundamentals
If you didn't go to school for CS, there's a good chance that something like [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) will be invaluable. Learning computer science will help you understand what's *really* going on.

If you just graduated from a CS program, then you already have a solid understanding of CS, but you probably lack software engineering skills. Learn things like how to test, how to write clean code, how to write design docs, how to review others' code, how to respond to criticism, and how to ask questions. Note that most of the things I just mentioned are communication skills.

## Experiment
It can be easy to fall into a rut of a certain specialty – backend, frontend, mobile (or even more niche – React, Kubernetes, Swift UI). If you get the opportunity, try doing projects at work that stretch you outside of your comfort zone. Chances are, you'll surprise yourself and pick it up quickly once you're over the initial hump. If you don't have the opportunity to do this at your job...

## Build things outside of your job
It makes me sad to see all these "TC or GTFO" saps who will only write code outside of work if it means grinding Leetcode so they can job hop. There's nothing wrong with interview prepping, but at least once in your life, try to make something real. You don't have to work on side projects all the time – in fact, you should definitely have a life outside of code. But at least once, just try seeing what you're capable when you're in creative control and can make all your own decisions.

## People > code
Your relationships with your coworkers and friends should long outlast the code you write.

## Don't be an asshole
Even if you're not outwardly mean, don't have a mean internal monologue either. Everyone knows what an asshole smells like.

## Take care of your health
It's cliché, but be sure to get enough sleep, find a physical hobby that you enjoy, and consider eating fiber once in a while.

Also: ergonomics matter. Don't wait until your thirties to learn this.

## Fall in love with problems, not solutions.
A problem will grow you by motivating you to find new solutions. A solution will limit you to looking only for the things it can solve.

In some ways, it's a manner of perspective. Databases and programming languages are solutions to their users, but to their *creators* they're also a big bag of juicy problems. You don't create a new database unless the existing ones can't solve your problem.

Maybe this advice could be rephrased as "Focus on creating, not consuming."

## Don't become a manager just because you think you're "supposed" to
If you do become a manager, recognize that you won't automatically be good at it. Even if you think you're a natural, you don't yet have the experience to even judge your own performance very well. Treat it as a brand new skill set that you need to cultivate.

## Be true to yourself
People have different reasons for getting into this profession. Some people just love to code, and couldn't imagine doing anything else. For some, it's a stable career that allows them to provide for their family. Don't conflate others' reasons for your own – if you do, you'll always be dissatisfied. Find your "why" and pursue it unapologetically.
